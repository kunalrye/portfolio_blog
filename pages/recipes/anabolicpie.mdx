# pie as a daily snack
Fruit pies are a classic dessert. Unfortunately I can only eat them so often without feeling guilty. I really like blueberry and apple pie, and found that this snack hits similarly to a slice. 

## ingredients
I use these rough estimates to get to a calorie count that is satiating for me.

Calorie count: ~300

### core ingredients
- 340g Fat free greek yogurt
- 1 Apple or 1.5 cups of frozen blueberries
- 1-2 Graham crackers or 1 serving of your favorite granola (preferably cinnamon based)
- 1 tsp Real maple syrup (/sugar free maple syrup / artificial sweetner)

### seasonings
- Cinnamon 
- Nutmeg (optional)


## steps
1. Dice the apple and toss with cinnamon / nutmeg in a bowl. If blueberries, just measure out the frozen blueberries and put in a bowl. 
2. Warm the apple mix for 45 seconds in the microwave or the frozen blueberries for 2 minutes (should be jammy). If you want to get fancy you can cook these in a pan (apples with some water and syrup and blueberries as is) until a jammy texture is achieved. 
3. Crush the graham crackers / granola and mix into the fruit. 
4. Let the mixture cool for a couple minutes (can stir to expedite)
5. Add greek yogurt on top 
6. Enjoy 

## additional mix ins
- Some light whipped cream is a great add on
