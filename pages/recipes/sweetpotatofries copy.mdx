# sweet potato fries
Fries are great but, again not something I can fit into my daily diet. 

## ingredients
I use these rough estimates for the ingredients:

### core ingredients
- n sweet potatoes (I usually have 1 large one [~200g] for myself or 2 mid sized [~150] sweet potatoes)

### seasonings

- Salt / Black Pepper / Garlic Salt (you can get away with roasting sweet potatoes with these without stuff burning)
- Other spice mixes (if you want to use some other kinds of seasoning, I would recommend using some oil to add the seasoning to the sweet potatoes)

## steps
1. Preheat the oven to 440 degrees (play with the temperature / time to avoid burning your sweet potatoes but still reaching some crispiness)
2. Rinse and peel sweet potatoes. Cut each potato length-wise twice then chop each remaining piece to around 1/2 inch thick pieces
3. Take a sheet pan and cover with parchment paper or foil and lightly spray with oil (note: if you season and toss the sweet potatoes in oil prior this can be skipped). 
4. Spread the sweet potatoes evenly in the pan. If the pan becomes too crowded move some to another tray so that the sweet potatoes can get crispy. Spray the top lightly with oil and season with salt and pepper or garlic salt.
5. Put the tray in the oven for 40-45 minutes or until the sweet potatoes start to develop dark brown spots.
6. Take the tray out of the oven and let cool for 5 minutes.


## other potatoes
This can easily work with other potatoes but depending on the type, you may not get the same results. Sweet potatoes work great because you can roast them and they turn out pretty crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I found that Yukon Golds work in this same way, but if you want to do Russett, probably would need some soaking time to remove the starches to yield that same crispy and fluffy texture.
