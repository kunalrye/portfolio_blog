# banana bread
Attempting to recreate my mom's banana bread :)

## ingredients
Again with any baked good, using a scale is generally better than approximating, so I tried to be a bit more exact. 

### servings
This recipe makes around 8 servings of banana bread

### core ingredients
#### dry ingredients
- 275g whole wheat flour (I use Bob's Red Mill Whole Wheat Flour)
- 1.5 teaspons of baking soda
- 0.5 teaspoons of fine sea salt
- 1 cup of mini chocolate chips (I use semi-sweet chocolate chips)
#### wet ingredients
- 0.5 cup of real maple syrup (OG recipe called for 1 cup of light brown sugar)
- 1/3 cup of 2% Fage Greek Yogurt (OG recipe said "plain" Greek Yogurt, probably full fat but I only had 2% on hand)
- 2 eggs
- 6 tbsp melted butter (I use KerryGold Butter)
- 4 very ripe bananas
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## steps
1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees + grease a small loaf pan or add parchment paper and some spray to a loaf pan
2. Get a large bowl and peel and mash the bananas using a fork. 
3. Mix in the melted butter, yogurt, eggs, maple syrup, and vanilla until mostly combined (some banana chunks may remain)
4. In a different bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, and salt
5. Slowly mix in the dry mix into the banana mixture until uniform
6. Stir in the chocolate chips
7. Pour the batter into the loaf pan, try to spread it evenly across the pan
8. Place into the oven and cook for around 60 - 75 minutes depending on your oven and how the banana bread cooks. To check doneness insert a toothpick / longer stick type thing and if it comes out clean, you are good.
9. After removing from the oven, let sit on the counter in the loaf pan for 10 minutes before removing and cooling completely
