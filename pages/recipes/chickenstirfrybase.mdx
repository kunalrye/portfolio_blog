# chicken & vegetable stir fry
For most of 2022-2023, I avoided chicken breast because I could never get it right and preferred the higher fat content
of chicken thighs. However, I finally figured out how to make chicken breast (for stir fry) that is not dry and develops
a nice crust like chicken thighs do when cooked in the pan.

## ingredients
I usually eyeball the amounts here but this is a good approximation that can be scaled up or down.

### servings
This recipe makes around 3 servings of stir-fry.

### core ingredients
- 2.8 to 3 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast
- 2 Zucchini
- 1 box of shiitake mushrooms
- 1 box of oyster mushrooms
- 1 onion
- 5 cloves of garlic
- 1 tbsp of ginger
- 4 tbsp of corn starch
- 4 tbsp of soy sauce or a premade stir-fry sauce
- 2 tbsp of gochujang (optional)
- 2-3 tbsp of sesame oil
- salt and pepper to taste

## steps
1. Remove the chicken breast from your fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour.
2. Cut the chicken breast into 2 inch cubes and season with salt and let it sit for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes,
   add 4 tbsp of corn starch and mix well till the pieces are coated evenly
3. While the chicken is sitting, cut the zucchini into 1/2 inch thick slices, cut the onion into 1/2 inch thick slices,
   and cut the mushrooms into 1/4 inch thick slices.
4. Mince the garlic and ginger.
5. Heat up a large pan on medium-high heat and add 1 tbsp of sesame oil.
6. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken breast and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side. You want to get a nice browning on
   the chicken breast pieces. Make sure not to crowd the pan (it usually takes me 3 batches to cook 3 lbs of chicken in a large pan).
7. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan and set it aside.
8. Turn the heat to high, add 1 tbsp of sesame oil, then add the onions and cook for 2 minutes.
9. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute.
10. Add the mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes.
11. Add the zucchini and cook for 2-3 minutes.
12. Add the chicken back to the pan and add 4 tbsp of soy sauce or a premade stir-fry sauce and mix well.
13. Add 2 tbsp of gochujang (optional) and mix well.
14. Cook for 2-3 minutes on low and serve.
