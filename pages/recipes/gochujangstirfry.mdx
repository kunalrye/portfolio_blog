# gochujang stir fry
As part of my foray into learning different cuisines, I picked up some gochujang from trader joes to eventually use in either a noodle dish or some kind of stir fry. I have been trying to eat more varieties of vegetables recently, so this was a great way to mix it up and also try out gochujang.

## ingredients
I would say that this is pretty healthy. I didn't use any additional oils and the sauce itself doesn't have any oil in it. 

### core ingredients
- ~1.5 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs
- 2 containers of trader joes stir fry vegetable mix (first time making it and was too lazy to buy all the different veggies [mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, peas, etc..])
- 1 thumb sized piece of ginger
- 4-5 cloves of garlic
- 3 heaping tablespoons of gochujang
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon of organic honey
- I didn't add these to the sauce but probably better with them (2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon sherry, 1 tablespoon sesame oil)
- (you can add whatever carb you want, I ended up just using a quick brown rice and quinoa)


## steps
1. If you want to, lay the chicken thighs out on a cutting board and slice into them such that they become relatively even thickness (makes cooking easier)
2. Season the chicken thighs with garlic salt and pepper 
3. Preheat a large non-stick pan on high, and add the chicken thighs
4. Cook the chicken thighs till a nice brown crust develops on one side before flipping and doing the same on the other side (cook till 165+ Fahreneheit internal)
5. Remove from pan and slice into whatever size pieces you want for your stir fry
