# blueberry pancakes
Maybe you can see a trend here, but generally the foods I make skew lower added sugar and lower fat than a traditional recipe. I try to a toe the line between healthy and still tasting good (maybe like 80% of the way there taste-wise).

## ingredients
With pancakes or any baked good, using a scale is generally better than approximating, so I tried to be a bit more exact. 

### servings
This recipe makes around 2 servings of 3 pancakes each 

### core ingredients
- 5 oz whole wheat flour (I use Bob's Red Mill Whole Wheat Flour)
- 2 tsp sugar or 2 tsp Swerve or nothing at all (still ends up tasting great)
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup fat free milk
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp melted butter (I use KerryGold Butter, this is actually also optional)
- protein powder (I use unflavored collagen protein ~= 40g protein)
- frozen blueberries
- chocolate chips

### seasonings
- 100% natural maple syrup (only the real stuff)

## steps
1. Starting with the dry ingredients, mix the flour, protein powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. 
2. In a separate bowl, melt the butter and let it cool before mixing the other wet ingredients. 
3. Add the milk and egg and mix well once the melted butter has cooled down. 
4. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry mix and mix just until you no longer see dry powder, the small lumps can remain. 
5. Preheat a pan on medium/medium-high heat, and grease with either butter or nonstick spray (I use avacado oil spray)
6. Pour the batter out into the pan to the size of pancakes you want (with these measurements and servings I usually go for 3-4 inches in diameter on the pour, as it spreads)
7. Add berries or chocolate chips at this point (as many as you want)
8. Cook for around 2-3 minutes until the bottom is slightly browned. 
9. Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes - this side should also be golden brown. 
10. If you are doing multiple sets of pancakes on the same pan, you can probably reduce the heat on the pan after the first batch and adjust the cook time as needed (probably will be about the same)
11. Serve with maple syrup, fruit, or a fruit syrup.
