# my recommendations
here lies a collection of products that I thoroughly enjoy using üëáüèæ

hopefully I keep this updated 


#### apps

- **Dark Sky**: Apple bought them, but the app still lives on (on iOS). During my time at Rice, Dark Sky saved me from getting soaked more times than I can count. The precipitation predictions were spot on and prompt. However, beyond the neat features, the base UI has always been my favorite. When I look at the weather for the day, the high and low temperatures are great, but why not just show a distribution of the temperatures throughout the day? Dark Sky does exactly this, allowing me to take a quick look at the weather for the day and understand what I need to wear depending on what time it is. 

- **Winno**: During the 2020 election, I realized how painful it was to stay on top of the news. There were too many sources, too much overlap, and a lot of noise to filter through. I was looking at Twitter, Reddit, NY Times, WSJ, and cable news, but I still never felt like I had a good grasp of the timeline of events or any sense of a single news story. Winno lets me see fact-checked stories in a timeline format so I can see what happened earlier for a specific topic, have the full timeline of events easily available for me, and the sources for each headline. I stopped checking Reddit, Twitter, and news apps for headlines after downloading the app.
