### Breathe. Give yourself a chance to listen to yourself. 
 
 Now, more than ever, the amount of information available on any topic is bottomless. Now, more than ever, the number of people creating content is bottomless. 
 Now, more than ever, the number of people curating content is growing. 
 Now, more than ever, you need to take a break from it all. 
 
 Society has identified that excess of certain things is detrimental to your health; social media, sugar, etc. So is information. 
 
 With the ability to consume so much, it can often feel like you are drowning in content, in the backlog of books you have to read, the deluge of new songs on Spotify, the newest podcast on that new thing you are following. 
 
 A lot of this content is great; individuals who have learned a ton and now want to give back, individuals who are influential due to what they have done, icons of industry and sport. They can all bring their perspectives on life to your eyes and ears through podcasts, tweets, books, writings, music, guides, maps. I am sure all of us have experienced moments where we gleaned great insights from this content. But as valuable as it may seem, or as smart as they might be, your own thoughts and insights deserve airtime.

Especially since all of this great content is available, whether for knowledge or entertainment, it is ever more important to stop consuming it for a bit. I had this realization in the Winter of 2020 while I was doing my college classes at home. After watching hours of lectures, I would consume hours of YouTube. Separate from this habit, I had started doing daily walks. At the start, to get into this habit, I had been watching YouTube while walking. After formalizing the habit, I stopped watching YouTube and just walking, without listening to anything. That break from consumption made me realize the value in just being with yourself. Listening to myself, exploring my own thoughts, and just simmering in that mindspace. For me, this emerged through the daily walk, which became somewhat meditative. For someone else, this could be through simply sitting down without a device, for others this could be through writing, but in my opinion, try to do it without someone else's content filling your mind. Being alone with your own thoughts allows you to process, synthesize, create, but more arguably more importantly, think with yourself.
