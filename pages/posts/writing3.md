### Everyone really has their own path, search for answers within/with yourself rather than from others. 
 
After reading Siddhartha (by Herman Hesse), I spent a good amount of time reflecting on the different lessons Siddhartha learns as well as what is higlighted with his interactions with other characters like Govinda and Gotama. While the book is said to be interpretation on the origins of Buddhism, many of the takeaways I had came from the journey of finding your own purpose, or searching within yourself rather than externally. 

Some of my favorite quotes from Siddhartha include:

> No, there was no teaching a truly searching person, someone who truly wanted to find, could accept. But he who had found, he could approve of any teachings, every path, every goal, there was nothing standing between him and all the other thousand any more who lived in that what is eternal, who breathed what is divine. 

> Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishness ... Knowledge can be conveyed, but not wisdom. It can be found, it can be lived, it is possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it cannot be expressed in words and taught.

The whole dialogue between Govinda and Siddhartha when Govinda meets Siddartha at the river towards the tail end of the book is really intriguing! Overall, Siddartha was one of the first philosophical books I had read in a while, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I strongly recommend reading it, but more importantly taking the time to reflect on the lessons that Siddhartha learns from his journey to reach enlightenment.
