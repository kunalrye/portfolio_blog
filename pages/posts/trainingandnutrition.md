## Training Goals

I've gotten serious about cycling over the last 2 years in San Francisco. This has transitioned my training goals from
purely trying to increase how much I can lift across squat, bench, deadlift, to striking a balance between the benefits
of weight training with cycling performance.

At the end of my "weightlifting" block, I maxed out at a 335 squat, 185 bench, and 315 deadlift, and since then I
haven't really been able to maintain any of those numbers with increased cycling volume.

My current cycling goals are achieving a sub 8:00 Hawk Hill time completely solo, and more generally, increasing my FTP.
To this end I have been reading more about how structured training works in endurance sports to create my own plan. So
far, I have only added 1 interval session of 4x10 at z3/z4 HR/Power per week.

## Old Weight Training Plan

This [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSckwGxC1GmgVnEPD51P50_ReHOdond9IowU7ZO9SOlyYUl4Yrj8acD8RQEw2CFlDlyQo7BE_olqDmF/pubhtml?gid=1410560354&single=true)
contains my old training program that I have made based on my previous programs and my new goals.

In 2021 to 2023 I focused on improving my flexibility with the end goal of being able to dunk. After working on that for
a year, I was able to dunk a volleyball, but am beginning to plateau on vertical gains.

## Nutrition

As many people do in college, I messed around in the gym without taking the time to understand what begets progress. My
peak weight in college reached 180 lbs, but my body composition at the time was much more fat than muscle as my ORM's
were insignificant. During the pandemic I decided to hone in on my diet, tuning it for both health, building muscle, and
even my productivity. Through experimentation and lots of reading, I adopted this framework for my diet to lose 15 lbs
and build muscle simultaneously (I was close to 2x stronger on some lifts at my leanest weight which is hilarious).

* Eat 1g of protein per lb of bodyweight
* Reduce fats during lunch and breakfast to reduce sleepiness during the day
    * I found that eating relatively more fats during lunch would cause a post lunch crash even if I walked around after
      the meal for a bit, so I have made this adjustment to my diet
* Increase fiber intake via vegetables, fruits, and whole grains to improve gut health and reduce inflammation
* Eat lots of whole foods (it just makes sense that this is healthier)
* Remove powders from my diet (no protein powder, no creatine, no preworkout)
* Limit caffeine from my diet (I never got obsessed with coffee, and so this was easy to do for me)
