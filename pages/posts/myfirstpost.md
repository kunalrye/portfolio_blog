# my recommendations
Here lies a collection of products that I thoroughly enjoy using üëáüèæ
Hopefully I keep this updated 


#### apps

- **Dark Sky**: Apple bought them, but the app still lives on (on iOS). During my time at Rice, Dark Sky saved me from getting soaked more times than I can count. The precipitation predictions were spot on and prompt. However, beyond the neat features, the base UI has always been my favorite. When I look at the weather for the day, the high and low temperatures are great, but why not just show a distribution of the temperatures throughout the day? Dark Sky does exactly this, allowing me to take a quick look at the weather for the day and understand what I need to wear depending on what time it is. 

- **Winno**: During the 2020 election, I realized how painful it was to stay on top of the news. There were too many sources, too much overlap, and a lot of noise to filter through. I was looking at Twitter, Reddit, NY Times, WSJ, and cable news, but I still never felt like I had a good grasp of the timeline of events or any sense of a single news story. Winno lets me see fact-checked stories in a timeline format so I can see what happened earlier for a specific topic, have the full timeline of events easily available for me, and the sources for each headline. I stopped checking Reddit, Twitter, and news apps for headlines after downloading the app. 

#### clothing

- **Ten Thousand Shorts**: I used to love Lululemon for workout shorts. I have their pacebreakers, surge shorts, and THE shorts. I liked the material on the surge shorts but disliked the lack of pockets and how open the leg openings were, although I understand they were designed for running. Ten Thousand shorts are made out of material quite similar to the surge shorts, are super breathable, and seem to not stink after multiple workouts. I have their interval and session shorts and they have both quickly become my favorites.
