# Kunal Rai

hey, i'm kunal. I am currently building [Wearloom](https://wearloom.com), the hub for resale fashion.

I just graduated from Rice (21') where I majored in electrical and computer engineering.  
I focused on applied machine learning and data science during my time at Rice while also learning a bit about design & entrepreneurship.    
 
- recently have been getting back into reading, currently reading Siddartha among others (see books).  
- still continuing to spend a good chunk of time every day either 🏋🏽 or 🚴‍♂️  
- an ongoing effort of mine is learning how to cook
