# Kunal Rai

hey, i'm kunal. I am currently building Wearloom, the hub for resale fashion.

I just graduated from Rice (21') where I majored in electrical and computer engineering. 
I focused on applied machine learning and data science during my time at Rice while also learning a bit about design & entrepreneurship. 

recently have been getting back into reading, currently reading Zero to One and finishing up Atomic Habits. 
still continuing to spend a good chunk of time every day 🏋🏽 or 🚴‍♂️
& trying to become a better 👨🏾‍🍳 ; doubling down on learning to cook more quick, tasty meals
