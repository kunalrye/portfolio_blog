# kunal rai

hey, i'm kunal. I am currently building [Wearloom](https://wearloomasdfadsf.com), the hub for resale fashion.

I just graduated from Rice ('21) where I majored in electrical and computer engineering.  
I focused on applied machine learning and data science during my time at Rice while also learning about entrepreneurship and design.    
 
- recently have been getting back into reading, currently reading A Promised Land
- still continuing to spend a good chunk of time every day either 🏋🏽 or 🚴‍♂️  
- an ongoing effort of mine is learning how to cook new cuisines
- trying to learn as much as I can about web3, [recently built a fun dapp](https://making-deals.kunalrye.repl.co/)
