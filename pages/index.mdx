# kunal rai

hey, i'm kunal. I am currently building [gently](https://gently.com), the demand layer for secondhand shopping.

I just graduated from Rice ('21) where I majored in electrical and computer engineering.  
I focused on applied machine learning and data science during my time at Rice while also learning about entrepreneurship and design.    
 
- recently have been getting back into reading, currently reading Shogun
- still continuing to spend a good chunk of time every day either 🏋🏽 or 🚴‍♂️  
- an ongoing effort of mine is learning how to cook new cuisines
